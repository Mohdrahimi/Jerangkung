# AI Model Training & Testing

A machine learning project focused on training, evaluating, and testing an AI model. This repository includes all scripts, configurations, and datasets used to build and validate the model.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the full workflow of an AI model lifecycle:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Testing and performance analysis

The project is designed for flexibility — you can plug in your own data or models to extend functionality.
